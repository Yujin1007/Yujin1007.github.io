<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research interest lies in the area of <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>, both practical applications and theoretical perspectives.
I focus on solving sequential decision-making problems for real-world autonomous learning systems!
These are the questions that I am digging these days. 

1️⃣ How can an agent acquire skills with minimal (or without) human-engineered intervention?

2️⃣ How can an agent acquire general-purpose skills to efficiently solve practical, long-horizon tasks?

3️⃣ What are the key differences that distinguish AI agents from humans in the process of learning new skills? What aspects of human learning can AI systems leverage?

I am a research scientist at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology [(KIST)]( https://eng.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do) under the amazing supervision of a senior researcher, [Yisoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/kist-arc/home/people?authuser=0). Before that, I received my M.S. from Korea University under the supervision of Professor [Myo-Taeg Lim](http://cml.korea.ac.kr/), where I studied reinforcement learning and path planning for autonomous driving. I received my B.S. from the University of Seoul. I finished internship at Hyundai Motor Group, working on developing autonomous driving decision-making and control.
